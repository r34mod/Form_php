# Form_php
Create form with php and sql and differents windows to show a table with information


##################################################################################################################################

 I create some differents files and folders, to separte with categories, like "Views", "Functions"
 
To execute, is the index.php file that it calls login.php or registrar.php depends if you have got account 
on databases.


Continue, you watch a page with two bottons, one of that is 'Persona' to view a table with information about differents users.
The other one, if deporte with information about sports and the user's id.


####################################################################################################################################

I create 2 objects, Persona and Deporte with gets and sets. Another class is PersonaDao and DeporteDao that I include all functions like
create a table, connect to databases and differents methods that I need to use it in this project(addUser, modUser...)


Finally, this is all that you need to do, or you can change some things if you want, like customize with css :D
